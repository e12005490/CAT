The length extension attack terms a class of attacks arising from invalid use of hash functions as message authentication codes, enabling us to forge a valid tags for known but previously unauthenticated messages.

If you already know about hash functions and :term:`MACs<MAC>`, you may skip to the `length extension`_ section.

Cryptographic Hash Functions
----------------------------

Cryptographic hash functions reduce an arbitrary length input to a fixed length bit-string while adhering to three core properties.

.. math::

    H: \{0,1\}^* \to \{0,1\}^n

.. note::

    Properties of cryptographic hash functions:

    Collision resistance
        It's (computationally) infeasible to obtain two :math:`x` and :math:`x'`, such that :math:`H(x) = H(x')`.

    Second preimage resistance
        Given :math:`x \in \{0,1\}^*` its infeasible to obtain an :math:`x' \neq x`, such that :math:`H(x) = H(x')`.

    Preimage resistance (One-wayness)
        Given :math:`y = H(x)`, it's infeasible to find any :math:`x'`, such that :math:`H(x) = H(x')`.

Since it's hard to build and analyze a hash-function from the ground up, we build collision-resistant one-way compression functions instead:

.. math::

   h: \{0,1\}^m \to \{0,1\}^n


.. note::
    In general, collision resistance implies second preimage resistance.
    For hash functions collision resistance also implies one-wayness.

    .. For compression functions, one-wayness is only implied by collision resistance, when the compression function is sufficiently compressing (m = :math:`\omega(\log n)`).

Using the compression function we can apply a domain extension, like the Merkle-Damg책rd construction.

Given a fixed-length collision resistant compression function :math:`h: \{0,1\}^{2n} \to \{0,1\}^n`, the Merkle-Damg책rd constructs a collision resistant hash function :math:`H`:

#. Append a 1 bit at the end of the message
#. Pad the input with zeros to a multiple of :math:`n`.
#. Append a block containing the :math:`n` bit representation of the message length (or add it in the padding block, if there are at least :math:`n` padding bits)
#. Set :math:`z = \IV = 0^n` (the :term:`IV` may be arbitrary)
#. For each block :math:`i` set :math:`z = h(z_{i-1}\|x_i)`
#. Output :math:`z`

Unfortunately, or luckily for us, hash functions were incorrectly used to construct :term:`MACs<MAC>`.
Reviewing the properties of cryptographic hash functions, they don't ensure that given :math:`H_{\IV}(m)` its infeasible to find :math:`H_{\IV}(\pad(m) \| m')`.
This is a property implied by the core security definition of :term:`MACs<MAC>`.
You may already see how, given :math:`H_{\IV}(m)` and the length of :math:`m`, it's possible to append another block at the end of the depicted chain and compute :math:`H_{\IV}(\pad(m) \| m')`.

:term:`MACs<MAC>` (Message Authentication Codes)
------------------------------------------------

A :term:`MAC` consists of three algorithms:

:math:`\Gen(1^n)`
   A key generation algorithm, given an input in the length of the security parameter :math:`n`.
:math:`\Mac_k(m)`
   A tag generation algorithm, which given a message :math:`m \in \{0,1\}^*` outputs a tag :math:`t \in \{0,1\}^n`.
:math:`\Vrfy_k(m, t)`
   A verification algorithm, which given a key :math:`k`, a message :math:`m` and a tag :math:`t` outputs whether the tag is a valid for the given message under the key :math:`k`.
   If the Mac is deterministic, then by canonical verification we can simply recompute the tag for the given message and key and check whether it's the tag :math:`t`.

A :term:`MAC` is considered secure if its infeasible to determine the tag of a (previously unauthenticated) message, when we are given access to a MAC oracle, which yields the tags of any requested message.

Length Extension
----------------

Let's try to construct a MAC using a Merkle-Damg책rd hash function :math:`H_{\IV}(\cdot)`.

.. math::

   \begin{align*}
      \Mac_k(m) &= H_{0^n}(k\|m)\\
      \Vrfy_k(m, t) &= H_{0^n}(k\|m) \stackrel{?}{=} t
   \end{align*}

This theoretical gap translates to a practical attack on the constructed insecure MAC.
In fact for Merkle-Damg책rd constructions, when we know :math:`m` and the length of :math:`k`, we may append another block and compute :math:`\Mac_k(\pad(m) \| m') = H_{0^n}(\pad(m)\|m') = H_{\pad(m)}(m')`.
We need to know the length of :math:`k` to pad the message correctly during hashing.

   MAC

      Message Authentication Code. Enables symmetric authentication and verification of messages. In contrast to cryptographic hash functions, MACs are keyed, and provide entirely different properties.
